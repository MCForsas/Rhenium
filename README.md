An android game where you drive around mars and smash asteroids

### About the game

This is a game set on Mars. All you do is drive around and pickup gems. Your objective is to pickup as many gems as possible and unlock all the skins. To do this you drive around the planet's surface, avoiding meteor craters, which after sometime turn into gems, which you can collect.
With the collected gems you can buy skins at the game shop and pimp your ride. Not much after that.
control by tapping left or right side of the screen.

### Some remarks

This was my attempt at brainstorming and creating a game in 48 hours! It actually took over two weeks... Anyway it was a fun project to work on, needs ton's of polish, but for now at least it's one of the few projects I actually finished to a plyable state, where I wouldn't mind showing it to the public.
